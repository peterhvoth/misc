"
390,3,"The States Parties to this Convention,
"
391,4,"Prompted  by the desire to settle, in a spirit of mutual understanding and
cooperation, all issues relating to the law of the sea and aware of the historic
significance  of  this  Convention  as  an  important  contribution  to  the
maintenance of peace, justice and progress for all peoples of the world,
"
392,5,"Noting  that developments since the United Nations Conferences on the
Law of the Sea held at Geneva in 1958 and 1960 have accentuated the need
for a new and generally acceptable Convention on the law of the sea,
"
393,6,"Conscious  that the problems of ocean space are closely interrelated and
"
394,7,"need to be considered as a whole,
"
395,8,"Recognizing  the desirability of establishing through this Convention,
with due regard for the sovereignty of all States, a legal order for the seas and
oceans which will facilitate international communication, and will promote
the peaceful uses of the seas and oceans, the equitable and efficient utilization
of their resources, the conservation of their living resources, and the study,
protection and preservation of the marine environment,
"
396,9,"Bearing in mind  that the achievement of these goals will contribute to
the realization of a just and equitable international economic order which
takes into account the interests and needs of mankind as a whole and, in
particular, the special interests and needs of developing countries, whether
coastal or land-locked,
"
397,10,"Desiring  by this Convention to develop the principles  embodied in
resolution 2749 (XXV) of 17 December 1970 in which the General Assembly
of the United Nations solemnly declared inter alia that the area of the seabed
and  ocean  floor  and  the  subsoil  thereof,  beyond  the  limits  of  national
jurisdiction, as well as its resources, are the common heritage of mankind, the
exploration and exploitation of which shall be carried out for the benefit of
mankind as a whole, irrespective of the geographical location of States,
"
398,11,"Believing  that the codification and progressive development of the law
of the sea achieved in this Convention will contribute to the strengthening of
peace,  security,  cooperation  and  friendly  relations  among  all  nations  in
conformity with the principles of justice and equal rights and will promote the
economic and social advancement of all peoples of the world, in accordance
with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations as set forth in the
Charter,
"
399,12,"Affirming  that matters not regulated by this Convention continue to be
"
400,13,"governed by the rules and principles of general international law,
"
401,14,"Have agreed as follows:

402,1,"26
"
403,2,"PART I
"
404,3,"INTRODUCTION
"
405,4,"Article 1
"
406,5,"Use of terms and scope
"
407,6,"1. For the purposes of this Convention:

environment, including estuaries, which results or is likely to result in such
deleterious effects as harm to living resources and marine life, hazards to
human health, hindrance to marine activities, including fishing and other
legitimate uses of the sea, impairment of quality for use of sea water and
reduction of amenities;
"
413,12,"(5) (a) ""dumping"" means:
"
414,13,"2.
"
415,14,"(1) ""States Parties"" means States which have consented to be bound
"
416,15,"by this Convention and for which this Convention is in force.
"
417,16,"(2) This  Convention  applies  mutatis  mutandis  to  the  entities
referred to in article 305, paragraph l(b), (c), (d), (e) and (f), which become
Parties to this Convention in accordance with the conditions relevant to each,
and to that extent ""States Parties"" refers to those entities.
"
418,17,"(b) ""dumping"" does not include:
"
419,18,"(i)
"
420,19,"(ii)
"
421,20,"(i)
"

any deliberate disposal of vessels, aircraft, platforms
or other man-made structures at sea;
"
423,22,"the disposal of wastes or other matter incidental to, or
derived  from  the  normal  operations  of  vessels,
aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at
sea and their equipment, other than wastes or other
matter transported by or to vessels, aircraft, platforms
or other man-made structures at sea, operating for the
purpose of disposal of such matter or derived from
the treatment of such wastes or other matter on such
vessels, aircraft, platforms or structures;
"
424,23,"(ii) placement of matter for a purpose other than the mere
disposal thereof, provided that such placement is not
contrary to the aims of this Convention.

"
427,3,"TERRITORIAL SEA AND CONTIGUOUS ZONE
"
428,4,"SECTION 1.  GENERAL PROVISIONS
"
429,5,"Article 2
"
430,6,"Legal status of the territorial sea, of the air space 
over the territorial sea and of its bed and subsoil
"
431,7,"1. The sovereignty of a coastal State extends, beyond its land territory
and internal waters and, in the case of an archipelagic State, its archipelagic
waters, to an adjacent belt of sea, described as the territorial sea.
"
432,8,"2. This sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as
"
433,9,"well as to its bed and subsoil.
"
434,10,"3. The sovereignty over the territorial sea is exercised subject to this
"
435,11,"Convention and to other rules of international law.
"
436,12,"SECTION 2.  LIMITS OF THE TERRITORIAL SEA
"
437,13,"Article 3
"
438,14,"Breadth of the territorial sea
"
439,15,"Every State has the right to establish the breadth of its territorial sea up
to  a  limit  not  exceeding  12  nautical  miles,  measured  from  baselines
determined in accordance with this Convention.
"
440,16,"Article 4
"
441,17,"Outer limit of the territorial sea
"
442,18,"The outer limit of the territorial sea is the line every point of which is at
a distance from the nearest point of the baseline equal to the breadth of the
territorial sea.
"
443,19,"Article 5
"
444,20,"Normal baseline
"
445,21,"Except where otherwise provided in this Convention, the normal baseline
for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the low-water line along the
coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the coastal
State.
"
446,22,"Article 6
Reefs
"
447,23,"In the case of islands situated on atolls or of islands having fringing
reefs,  the  baseline  for  measuring  the  breadth  of  the  territorial  sea  is  the
seaward low-water line of the reef, as shown by the appropriate symbol on
charts officially recognized by the coastal State.
"
448,1,"28
"
449,2,"Article 7
"
450,3,"Straight baselines
"
451,4,"1.
"
452,5,"In localities where the coastline is deeply indented and cut into, or
if there is a fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity, the
method of straight baselines joining appropriate points may be employed in
drawing the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.
2. Where  because  of  the  presence  of  a  delta  and  other  natural
conditions the coastline is highly unstable, the appropriate points may be
selected  along  the  furthest  seaward  extent  of  the  low-water  line  and,
notwithstanding subsequent regression of the low-water line, the straight
baselines  shall  remain  effective  until  changed  by  the  coastal  State  in
accordance with this Convention.
"
453,6,"3. The drawing of straight baselines must not depart to any appreciable
extent from the general direction of the coast, and the sea areas lying within
the lines must be sufficiently closely linked to the land domain to be subject
to the regime of internal waters.
"
454,7,"4. Straight baselines shall not be drawn to and from low-tide elevations,
unless lighthouses or similar installations which are permanently above sea
level have been built on them or except in instances where the drawing of
baselines  to  and  from  such  elevations  has  received  general  international
recognition.
"
455,8,"5. Where  the  method  of  straight  baselines  is  applicable  under
paragraph 1, account may be taken, in determining particular baselines, of
economic  interests  peculiar  to  the  region  concerned,  the  reality  and  the
importance of which are clearly evidenced by long usage.
"
456,9,"6. The system of straight baselines may not be applied by a State in
such a manner as to cut off the territorial sea of another State from the high
seas or an exclusive economic zone.
"
457,10,"Article 8
"
458,11,"Internal waters
"
459,12,"1. Except as provided in Part IV, waters on the landward side of the
"
460,13,"baseline of the territorial sea form part of the internal waters of the State.
"
461,14,"2. Where the establishment of a straight baseline in accordance with the
method set forth in article 7 has the effect of enclosing as internal waters
areas which had not previously been considered as such, a right of innocent
passage as provided in this Convention shall exist in those waters.
"
462,15,"Article 9
"
463,16,"Mouths of rivers
"
464,17,"If a river flows directly into the sea, the baseline shall be a straight line
across the mouth of the river between points on the low-water line of its
banks.
"
465,18,"Article 10
"
466,19,"Bays
"
467,20,"1. This article relates only to bays the coasts of which belong to a
"
468,21,"single State.
"
469,1,"29
"
470,2,"2. For  the  purposes  of  this  Convention,  a  bay  is  a  well-marked
indentation whose penetration is in such proportion to the width of its mouth
as to contain land-locked waters and constitute more than a mere curvature
of the coast.  An indentation shall not, however, be regarded as a bay unless
its area is as large as, or larger than, that of the semi-circle whose diameter is
a line drawn across the mouth of that indentation.
"
471,3,"3. For the purpose of measurement, the area of an indentation is that
lying between the low-water mark around the shore of the indentation and a
line  joining  the  low-water  mark  of  its  natural  entrance  points.    Where,
because of the presence of islands, an indentation has more than one mouth,
the semi-circle shall be drawn on a line as long as the sum total of the lengths
of the lines across the different mouths.  Islands within an indentation shall
be included as if they were part of the water area of the indentation.
"
472,4,"If the distance between the low-water marks of the natural entrance
points of a bay does not exceed 24 nautical miles, a closing line may be
drawn between these two low-water marks, and the waters enclosed thereby
shall be considered as internal waters.
"
473,5,"4.
"
474,6,"5. Where  the  distance  between  the  low-water  marks  of  the  natural
entrance points of a bay exceeds 24 nautical miles, a straight baseline of
24 nautical miles shall be drawn within the bay in such a manner as to enclose
the maximum area of water that is possible with a line of that length.
"
475,7,"6. The foregoing provisions do not apply to so-called ""historic"" bays,
or in any case where the system of straight baselines provided for in article 7
is applied.
"
476,8,"Article 11
"
477,9,"Ports
"
478,10,"For the purpose of delimiting the territorial sea, the outermost permanent
harbour works which form an integral part of the harbour system are regarded
as forming part of the coast.  Off-shore installations and artificial islands shall
not be considered as permanent harbour works.
"
479,11,"Article 12
Roadsteads
"
480,12,"Roadsteads  which  are  normally  used  for  the  loading,  unloading  and
anchoring of ships, and which would otherwise be situated wholly or partly
outside the outer limit of the territorial sea, are included in the territorial sea.
"
481,13,"Article 13
"
482,14,"Low-tide elevations
"
483,15,"1. A low-tide elevation is a naturally formed area of land which is
surrounded by and above water at low tide but submerged at high tide.  Where
a low-tide elevation is situated wholly or partly at a distance not exceeding
the breadth of the territorial sea from the mainland or an island, the low-water
line on that elevation may be used as the baseline for measuring the breadth
of the territorial sea.
"
484,16,"2. Where a low-tide elevation is wholly situated at a distance exceeding
the breadth of the territorial sea from the mainland or an island, it has no
territorial sea of its own.
"
485,1,"30
"
486,2,"Combination of methods for determining baselines
"
487,3,"Article 14
"
488,4,"The coastal State may determine baselines in turn by any of the methods
"
489,5,"provided for in the foregoing articles to suit different conditions.
"
490,6,"Article 15
"
491,7,"Delimitation of the territorial sea between States
"
492,8,"with opposite or adjacent coasts
"
493,9,"Where the coasts of two States are opposite or adjacent to each other,
neither of the two States is entitled, failing agreement between them to the
contrary, to extend its territorial sea beyond the median line every point of
which is equidistant from the nearest points on the baselines from which the
breadth of the territorial seas of each of the two States is measured.  The
above provision does not apply, however, where it is necessary by reason of
historic title or other special circumstances to delimit the territorial seas of the
two States in a way which is at variance therewith.
"
494,10,"Charts and lists of geographical coordinates
"
495,11,"Article 16
"
496,12,"1. The  baselines  for  measuring  the  breadth  of  the  territorial  sea
determined in accordance with articles 7, 9 and 10, or the limits derived
therefrom, and the lines of delimitation drawn in accordance with articles 12
and 15 shall be shown on charts of a scale or scales adequate for ascertaining
their position.  Alternatively, a list of geographical coordinates of points,
specifying the geodetic datum, may be substituted.
"
497,13,"2. The coastal State shall give due publicity to such charts or lists of
geographical coordinates and shall deposit a copy of each such chart or list
with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
"
498,14,"SECTION 3.  INNOCENT PASSAGE IN THE TERRITORIAL SEA
"
499,15,"SUBSECTION A.  RULES APPLICABLE TO ALL SHIPS
"
500,16,"Article 17
"
501,17,"Right of innocent passage
"
502,18,"Subject  to  this  Convention,  ships  of  all  States,  whether  coastal  or
land-locked, enjoy the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea.
"
503,19,"Article 18
"
504,20,"Meaning of passage
"
505,21,"1. Passage means navigation through the territorial sea for the purpose
"
506,22,"(a)
"
507,23,"traversing that sea without entering internal waters or calling at
a roadstead or port facility outside internal waters; or
"
508,24,"(b) proceeding to or from internal waters or a call at such roadstead
"
509,25,"of:
"
510,26,"or port facility.
"
511,27,"2. Passage shall be continuous and expeditious.  However, passage
includes stopping and anchoring, but only in so far as the same are incidental
"
512,1,"31
"
513,2,"to ordinary navigation or are rendered necessary by force majeure or distress
or for the purpose of rendering assistance to persons, ships or aircraft in
danger or distress.
"

"
1111,3,"that each ship, before registration and thereafter at appropriate
intervals, is surveyed by a qualified surveyor of ships, and has
on board such charts, nautical publications and navigational
equipment  and  instruments  as  are  appropriate  for  the  safe
navigation of the ship;
"
1112,4,"(b) that each ship is in the charge of a master and officers who
possess appropriate qualifications, in particular in seamanship,
navigation, communications and marine engineering, and that
the crew is appropriate in qualification and numbers for the
type, size, machinery and equipment of the ship;
that the master, officers and, to the extent appropriate, the crew
are fully conversant with and required to observe the applicable

required  to  conform  to  generally  accepted  international  regulations,
procedures and practices and to take any steps which may be necessary to
secure their observance.
"
1116,8,"6. A State which has clear grounds to believe that proper jurisdiction
and control with respect to a ship have not been exercised may report the facts
to the flag State.  Upon receiving such a report, the flag State shall investigate
the  matter  and,  if  appropriate,  take  any  action  necessary  to  remedy  the
situation.
"
1117,9,"7. Each State shall cause an inquiry to be held by or before a suitably
qualified  person  or  persons  into  every  marine  casualty  or  incident  of
navigation on the high seas involving a ship flying its flag and causing loss
of life or serious injury to nationals of another State or serious damage to
ships or installations of another State or to the marine environment.  The flag
State and the other State shall cooperate in the conduct of any inquiry held by

after due legal process, to pronounce the withdrawal of such certificates, even
if the holder is not a national of the State which issued them.

"
1161,11,"Article 103
"
1162,12,"Definition of a pirate ship or aircraft
"
1163,13,"A ship or aircraft is considered a pirate ship or aircraft if it is intended by
the persons in dominant control to be used for the purpose of committing one
of the acts referred to in article 101.  The same applies if the ship or aircraft
has been used to commit any such act, so long as it remains under the control
of the persons guilty of that act.

"
1165,15,"Article 104
"

"
1168,18,"Seizure of a pirate ship or aircraft
"
1169,19,"On the high seas, or in any other place outside the jurisdiction of any
State, every State may seize a pirate ship or aircraft, or a ship or aircraft taken
by piracy and under the control of pirates, and arrest the persons and seize the
property on board.  The courts of the State which carried out the seizure may

"
1175,6,"Article 107

"
1178,9,"Article 108
"
1179,10,"1. All  States  shall  cooperate  in  the  suppression  of  illicit  traffic  in
narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances engaged in by ships on the high
seas contrary to international conventions.
"
1180,11,"2. Any State which has reasonable grounds for believing that a ship

"
1184,15,"broadcasting from the high seas.
"
1185,16,"2. For the purposes of this Convention, ""unauthorized broadcasting""
means the transmission of sound radio or television broadcasts from a ship or
installation on the high seas intended for reception by the general public
contrary  to  international  regulations,  but  excluding  the  transmission  of
distress calls.
"
1186,17,"3. Any  person  engaged  in  unauthorized  broadcasting  may  be
"
1187,18,"prosecuted before the court of:
"
1188,19,"the flag State of the ship;
"
1189,20,"(a)
(b) the State of registry of the installation;

"
1191,22,"interference.
"
1192,23,"4. On the high seas, a State having jurisdiction in accordance with
paragraph 3 may, in conformity with article 110, arrest any person or ship
engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and seize the broadcasting apparatus.
"
1193,1,"63
"
1194,2,"Article 110
Right of visit
"
1195,3,"1. Except where acts of interference derive from powers conferred by
treaty, a warship which encounters on the high seas a foreign ship, other than
a ship entitled to complete immunity in accordance with articles 95 and 96,
is not justified in boarding it unless there is reasonable ground for suspecting
that:
"
1196,4,"the ship is engaged in piracy;
"
1197,5,"(a)
(b) the ship is engaged in the slave trade;
(c)
"
1198,6,"the ship is engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and the flag
State of the warship has jurisdiction under article 109;
"
1199,7,"(d) the ship is without nationality; or
(e)
"
1200,8,"though flying a foreign flag or refusing to show its flag, the ship
is, in reality, of the same nationality as the warship.
"
1201,9,"2.
"
1202,10,"In the cases provided for in paragraph 1, the warship may proceed
to verify the ship's right to fly its flag.  To this end, it may send a boat under
the command of an officer to the suspected ship.  If suspicion remains after
the documents have been checked, it may proceed to a further examination on
board the ship, which must be carried out with all possible consideration.
"
1203,11,"If the suspicions prove to be unfounded, and provided that the ship
boarded has not committed any act justifying them, it shall be compensated
for any loss or damage that may have been sustained.
"
1204,12,"4. These provisions apply mutatis mutandis to military aircraft.
5. These provisions also apply to any other duly authorized ships or
"
1205,13,"aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service.
"
1206,14,"3.
"
1207,15,"Article 111
"
1208,16,"Right of hot pursuit
"
1209,17,"1. The  hot  pursuit  of  a  foreign  ship  may  be  undertaken  when  the
competent authorities of the coastal State have good reason to believe that the
ship has violated the laws and regulations of that State.  Such pursuit must be
commenced when the foreign ship or one of its boats is within the internal
waters, the archipelagic waters, the territorial sea or the contiguous zone of
the pursuing State, and may only be continued outside the territorial sea or the
contiguous zone if the pursuit has not been interrupted.  It is not necessary
that,  at  the  time  when  the  foreign  ship  within  the  territorial  sea  or  the
contiguous zone receives the order to stop, the ship giving the order should
likewise be within the territorial sea or the contiguous zone.  If the foreign
ship is within a contiguous zone, as defined in article 33, the pursuit may only
be undertaken if there has been a violation of the rights for the protection of
which the zone was established.
"
1210,18,"2. The right of hot pursuit shall apply mutatis mutandis to violations in
the exclusive economic zone or on the continental shelf, including safety
zones around continental shelf installations, of the laws and regulations of the
coastal State applicable in accordance with this Convention to the exclusive
economic zone or the continental shelf, including such safety zones.
"
1211,19,"3. The right of hot pursuit ceases as soon as the ship pursued enters the
"
1212,20,"territorial sea of its own State or of a third State.
"
1213,21,"4. Hot pursuit is not deemed to have begun unless the pursuing ship has
satisfied itself by such practicable means as may be available that the ship
pursued or one of its boats or other craft working as a team and using the ship
"
1214,1,"64
"
1215,2,"pursued as a mother ship is within the limits of the territorial sea, or, as the
case may be, within the contiguous zone or the exclusive economic zone or
above the continental shelf.  The pursuit may only be commenced after a
visual or auditory signal to stop has been given at a distance which enables
it to be seen or heard by the foreign ship.
"
1216,3,"5. The  right  of  hot  pursuit  may  be  exercised  only  by  warships  or
military aircraft, or other ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as
being on government service and authorized to that effect.
"
1217,4,"6. Where hot pursuit is effected by an aircraft:
the  provisions  of  paragraphs  1 
mutatis mutandis;
"
1218,5,"(a)
"
1219,6,"to  4  shall  apply
"
1220,7,"(b) the aircraft giving the order to stop must itself actively pursue
the ship until a ship or another aircraft of the coastal State,
summoned  by  the  aircraft,  arrives  to  take  over  the  pursuit,
unless the aircraft is itself able to arrest the ship.  It does not
suffice to justify an arrest outside the territorial sea that the ship
was merely sighted by the aircraft as an offender or suspected
offender, if it was not both ordered to stop and pursued by the
aircraft  itself  or  other  aircraft  or  ships  which  continue  the
pursuit without interruption.
"
1221,8,"7. The release of a ship arrested within the jurisdiction of a State and
escorted to a port of that State for the purposes of an inquiry before the
competent authorities may not be claimed solely on the ground that the ship,
in the course of its voyage, was escorted across a portion of the exclusive
economic zone or the high seas, if the circumstances rendered this necessary.
8. Where a ship has been stopped or arrested outside the territorial sea
in circumstances which do not justify the exercise of the right of hot pursuit,
it shall be compensated for any loss or damage that may have been thereby
sustained.
"
1222,9,"Right to lay submarine cables and pipelines
"
1223,10,"Article 112
"
1224,11,"1. All States are entitled to lay submarine cables and pipelines on the
"
1225,12,"bed of the high seas beyond the continental shelf.

"
1227,14,"Breaking or injury of a submarine cable or pipeline
"
1228,15,"Article 113
"
1229,16,"Every State shall adopt the laws and regulations necessary to provide that
the breaking or injury by a ship flying its flag or by a person subject to its
jurisdiction of a submarine cable beneath the high  seas done wilfully or
through culpable negligence, in such a manner as to be liable to interrupt or
obstruct telegraphic or telephonic communications, and similarly the breaking
or injury of a submarine pipeline or high-voltage power cable, shall be a
punishable offence.  This provision shall apply also to conduct calculated or
likely to result in such breaking or injury.  However, it shall not apply to any
break or injury caused by persons who acted merely with the legitimate object
of  saving  their  lives  or  their  ships,  after  having  taken  all  necessary
precautions to avoid such break or injury.

that, if persons subject to its jurisdiction who are the owners of a submarine
cable or pipeline beneath the high seas, in laying or repairing that cable or
pipeline, cause a break in or injury to another cable or pipeline, they shall
bear the cost of the repairs.

"
1236,7,"Indemnity for loss incurred in avoiding injury

the owners of ships who can prove that they have sacrificed an anchor, a net
or any other fishing gear, in order to avoid injuring a submarine cable or
pipeline, shall be indemnified by the owner of the cable or pipeline, provided
that the owner of the ship has taken all reasonable precautionary measures
beforehand.

subparagraph (b), for the year for which the production
authorization 
the  year
immediately prior to the year of the earliest commercial
production.
"
1474,7,"is  being  applied  for  and 
"
1475,8,"trend line values used for computing the nickel production
ceiling shall be those annual nickel consumption values
on  a  trend  line  computed  during  the  year  in  which  a
production authorization is issued.  The trend line shall be
derived  from  a  linear  regression  of  the  logarithms  of
actual  nickel  consumption  for  the  most  recent  15-year
period for which such data are available, time being the
independent variable.  This trend line shall be referred to
as the original trend line;
if the annual rate of increase of the original trend line is
less than 3 per cent, then the trend line used to determine
the quantities referred to in subparagraph (a) shall instead
be one passing through the original trend line at the value
for  the  first  year  of  the  relevant  15-year  period,  and
increasing at 3 per cent annually; provided however that
the  production  ceiling  established  for  any  year  of  the
interim period may not in any case exceed the difference
between the original trend line value for that year and the
original trend line value for the year immediately prior to
the commencement of the interim period.
"
1476,9,"5. The Authority shall reserve to the Enterprise for its initial production
a quantity of 38,000 metric tonnes of nickel from the available production
ceiling calculated pursuant to paragraph 4.
"
1477,10,"6.
"
1478,11,"(a) An  operator  may  in  any  year  produce  less  than  or  up  to
8 per cent more than the level of annual production of minerals
from  polymetallic  nodules  specified 
in  his  production
authorization, provided that the over-all amount of production
shall not exceed that specified in the authorization.  Any excess
over 8 per cent and up to 20 per cent in any year, or any excess
in the first and subsequent years following two consecutive

economic  zones  is  an  area  where  the  adoption  of  special
mandatory  measures  for  the  prevention  of  pollution  from
vessels is required for recognized technical reasons in relation
to its oceanographical and ecological conditions, as well as its
"
2024,1,"107
"
2025,2,"utilization or the protection of its resources and the particular
character  of  its  traffic,  the  coastal  States,  after  appropriate

in the territorial sea of a State has, during its passage therein, violated laws
and regulations of that State adopted in accordance with this Convention or
applicable international rules and standards for the prevention, reduction and
control  of  pollution  from  vessels,  that  State,  without  prejudice  to  the
application of the relevant provisions of Part II, section 3, may undertake
physical inspection of the vessel relating to the violation and may, where the
evidence so warrants, institute proceedings, including detention of the vessel,
in accordance with its laws, subject to the provisions of section 7.

exclusive economic zone, committed a violation referred to in paragraph 3
resulting in a substantial discharge causing or threatening significant pollution
of the marine environment, that State may undertake physical inspection of
the vessel for matters relating to the violation if the vessel has refused to give
information  or  if  the  information  supplied  by  the  vessel  is  manifestly  at
variance with the evident factual situation and if the circumstances of the case
justify such inspection.

exclusive economic zone, committed a violation referred to in paragraph 3
resulting in a discharge causing major damage or threat of major damage to
the coastline or related interests of the coastal State, or to any resources of its
territorial sea or exclusive economic zone, that State may, subject to section 7,
provided  that  the  evidence  so  warrants,  institute  proceedings,  including
detention of the vessel, in accordance with its laws.

"
2785,6,"Article 3
"
2786,7,"Exploration and exploitation
"
2787,8,"1. The Enterprise, States Parties, and the other entities referred to in
article 153, paragraph 2(b), may apply to the Authority for approval of plans
of work for activities in the Area.
"

applications  by  others  with  respect  to  reserved  areas  are  subject  to  the
additional requirements of article 9 of this Annex.
"
2789,10,"3. Exploration  and  exploitation  shall  be  carried  out  only  in  areas
specified  in  plans  of  work  referred  to  in  article  153,  paragraph  3,  and

relate  to  the  financial  and  technical  capabilities  of  the  applicant  and  his
performance under any previous contracts with the Authority.
"
2800,21,"3. Each applicant shall be sponsored by the State Party of which it is
a national unless the applicant has more than one nationality, as in the case
of a partnership or consortium of entities from several States, in which event
all  States  Parties  involved  shall  sponsor  the  application,  or  unless  the
"
2801,1,"149
"
2802,2,"applicant is effectively controlled by another State Party or its nationals, in
which event both States Parties shall sponsor the application.  The criteria and
procedures for implementation of the sponsorship requirements shall be set

responsibility  to  ensure,  within  their  legal  systems,  that  a  contractor  so
sponsored shall carry out activities in the Area in conformity with the terms
of its contract and its obligations under this Convention.  A sponsoring State
shall not, however, be liable for damage caused by any failure of a contractor
sponsored by it to comply with its obligations if that State Party has adopted
laws and regulations and taken administrative measures which are, within the
framework  of  its  legal  system,  reasonably  appropriate  for  securing
compliance by persons under its jurisdiction.
"
2804,4,"5. The procedures for assessing the qualifications of States Parties

obligations  created  by  the  provisions  of  Part  XI,  the  rules,
regulations and procedures of the Authority, the decisions of
the organs of the Authority and terms of his contracts with the

to  provide  the  Authority  with  a  written  assurance  that  his
obligations under the contract will be fulfilled in good faith;
"
2812,12,"(d) to comply with the provisions on the transfer of technology set
"
2813,13,"(c)
"
2814,14,"forth in article 5 of this Annex.
"

available to the Authority a general description of the equipment and methods
to  be  used  in  carrying  out  activities  in  the  Area,  and  other  relevant
non-proprietary information about the characteristics of such technology and
information as to where such technology is available.
"
2818,18,"2. Every  operator  shall  inform  the  Authority  of  revisions  in  the
description and information made available pursuant to paragraph 1 whenever
a substantial technological change or innovation is introduced.
"

"
2820,20,"following undertakings by the contractor:
"
2821,21,"(a)
"
2822,22,"to  make  available  to  the  Enterprise  on  fair  and  reasonable
commercial terms and conditions, whenever the Authority so
requests, the technology which he uses in carrying out activities
in the Area under the contract, which the contractor is legally
entitled to transfer.  This shall be done by means of licences or
other  appropriate  arrangements  which  the  contractor  shall
negotiate with the Enterprise and which shall be set forth in a
specific  agreement  supplementary  to  the  contract.    This
undertaking may be invoked only if the Enterprise finds that it
is unable to obtain the same or equally efficient and useful
"
2823,1,"150
"
2824,2,"(c)
"
2825,3,"technology  on  the  open  market  on  fair  and  reasonable
commercial terms and conditions;
"
2826,4,"(b) to obtain a written assurance from the owner of any technology
used in carrying out activities in the Area under the contract,
which is not generally available on the open market and which
is  not  covered  by  subparagraph  (a),  that  the  owner  will,
whenever  the  Authority  so  requests,  make  that  technology
available to the Enterprise under licence or other appropriate
arrangements and on fair and reasonable commercial terms and
conditions,  to  the  same  extent  as  made  available  to  the
contractor.  If this assurance is not obtained, the technology in
question shall not be used by the contractor in carrying out
activities in the Area;
to acquire from the owner by means of an enforceable contract,
upon the request of the Enterprise and if it is possible to do so
without  substantial  cost  to  the  contractor,  the  legal  right  to
transfer to the Enterprise any technology used by the contractor,
in carrying out activities in the Area under the contract, which
the contractor is otherwise not legally entitled to transfer and
which is not generally available on the open market.  In cases
where there is a substantial corporate relationship between the
contractor and the owner of the technology, the closeness of
this relationship and the degree of control or influence shall be
relevant to the determination whether all feasible measures have
been  taken  to  acquire  such  a  right.    In  cases  where  the
contractor exercises effective control over the owner, failure to
acquire  from  the  owner  the  legal  right  shall  be  considered
relevant  to  the  contractor's  qualification  for  any  subsequent
application for approval of a plan of work;
"
2827,5,"take 
"
2828,6,"the  Enterprise  of  any 
"
2829,7,"same  measures  as  are  prescribed 
"
2830,8,"(d) to facilitate, upon the request of the Enterprise, the acquisition
technology  covered  by
by 
subparagraph  (b),  under 
licence  or  other  appropriate
arrangements and on fair and reasonable commercial terms and
conditions, if the Enterprise decides to negotiate directly with
the owner of the technology;
to 
in
subparagraphs  (a),  (b),  (c)  and  (d)  for  the  benefit  of  a
developing  State  or  group  of  developing  States  which  has
applied for a contract under article 9 of this Annex, provided
that these measures shall be limited to the exploitation of the
part of the  area proposed by the contractor which has been
reserved pursuant to article 8 of this Annex and provided that
activities under the contract sought by the developing State or
group  of  developing  States  would  not  involve  transfer  of
technology to a third State or the nationals of a third State.  The
obligation under this provision shall only apply with respect to
any given contractor where technology has not been requested
by  the  Enterprise  or  transferred  by  that  contractor  to  the
Enterprise.

2831,9,"(e)
"
2832,10,"the 
"
2833,11,"4. Disputes concerning undertakings required by paragraph 3, like other
provisions  of  the  contracts,  shall  be  subject  to  compulsory  settlement  in

suspension  or  termination  of  the  contract  or  monetary  penalties  may  be
"
2834,1,"151
"
2835,2,"5.
"
2836,3,"ordered in accordance with article 18 of this Annex.  Disputes as to whether
offers made by the contractor are within the range of fair and reasonable
commercial terms and conditions may be submitted by either party to binding
commercial arbitration in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules
or such other arbitration rules as may be prescribed in the rules, regulations
and procedures of the Authority.  If the finding is that the offer made by the
contractor is not within the range of fair and reasonable commercial terms and
conditions, the contractor shall be given 45 days to revise his offer to bring
it within that range before the Authority takes any action in accordance with
article 18 of this Annex.
"
2837,4,"If  the  Enterprise  is  unable  to  obtain  on  fair  and  reasonable
commercial  terms  and  conditions  appropriate  technology  to  enable  it  to
commence in a timely manner the recovery and processing of minerals from
the Area, either the Council or the Assembly may convene a group of States
Parties composed of those which are engaged in activities in the Area, those
which have sponsored entities which are engaged in activities in the Area and
other  States  Parties  having  access  to  such  technology.    This  group  shall
consult  together  and  shall  take  effective  measures  to  ensure  that  such
technology  is  made  available  to  the  Enterprise  on  fair  and  reasonable
commercial  terms  and  conditions.    Each  such  State  Party  shall  take  all
feasible measures to this end within its own legal system.
"
2838,5,"In  the  case  of  joint  ventures  with  the  Enterprise,  transfer  of
technology  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  joint  venture
agreement.
"
2839,6,"7. The undertakings required by paragraph 3 shall be included in each
contract for the carrying out of activities in the Area until 10 years after the
commencement of commercial production by the Enterprise, and may be
invoked during that period.
"
2840,7,"8. For the purposes of this article, ""technology"" means the specialized
equipment and technical know-how, including manuals, designs, operating
instructions,  training  and  technical  advice  and  assistance,  necessary  to
assemble, maintain and operate a viable system and the legal right to use these
items for that purpose on a non-exclusive basis.

2844,11,"1. Six  months  after  the  entry  into  force  of  this  Convention,  and
thereafter each fourth month, the Authority shall take up for consideration
proposed plans of work.
"
2845,12,"2. When considering an application for approval of a plan of work in
"
2846,13,"the form of a contract, the Authority shall first ascertain whether:
"
2847,14,"(a)
"
2848,15,"the applicant has complied with the procedures established for
applications in accordance with article 4 of this Annex and has
given the Authority the undertakings and assurances required
by  that  article.    In  cases  of  non-compliance  with  these
procedures or in the absence of any of these undertakings and
assurances, the applicant shall be given 45 days to remedy these
defects;
"
2849,16,"(b) the applicant possesses the requisite qualifications provided for
"
2850,17,"in article 4 of this Annex.
"
2851,18,"3. All proposed plans of work shall be taken up in the order in which
they are received.  The proposed plans of work shall comply with and be
"
2852,1,"152
"
2853,2,"governed  by  the  relevant  provisions  of  this  Convention  and  the  rules,
regulations and procedures of the Authority, including those on operational
requirements, financial contributions and the undertakings concerning the
transfer  of  technology.    If  the  proposed  plans  of  work  conform  to  these
requirements, the Authority shall approve them provided that they are in
accordance with the uniform and non-discriminatory requirements set forth
in the rules, regulations and procedures of the Authority, unless:
"
2854,3,"(c)
"
2855,4,"(a) part or all of the area covered by the proposed plan of work is
included in an approved plan of work or a previously submitted
proposed plan of work which has not yet been finally acted on
by the Authority; 
"
2856,5,"(b) part or all of the area covered by the proposed plan of work is
disapproved  by  the  Authority  pursuant  to  article  162,
paragraph 2(x); or
the proposed plan of work has been submitted or sponsored by
a State Party which already holds:
(i) plans  of  work  for  exploration  and  exploitation  of
polymetallic nodules in non-reserved areas that, together
with either part of the area covered by the application for
a plan of work, exceed in size 30 per cent of a circular
area of 400,000 square kilometres surrounding the centre
of either part of the area covered by the proposed plan of

work submitted by a partnership or consortium shall be counted on a pro rata
basis  among  the  sponsoring  States  Parties  involved  in  accordance  with
article 4, paragraph 3, of this Annex.  The Authority may approve plans of
work covered by paragraph 3(c) if it determines that such approval would not
permit a State Party or entities sponsored by it to monopolize the conduct of
activities in the Area or to preclude other States Parties from activities in the
Area.
"
2859,8,"5. Notwithstanding paragraph 3(a), after the end of the interim period
specified in article 151, paragraph 3, the Authority may adopt by means of
rules, regulations and procedures other procedures and criteria consistent with
this  Convention  for  deciding  which  applicants  shall  have  plans  of  work
approved in cases of selection among applicants for a proposed area.  These
procedures and criteria shall ensure approval of plans of work on an equitable
and non-discriminatory basis.

"
2862,11,"1. Six  months  after  the  entry  into  force  of  this  Convention,  and
thereafter each fourth month, the Authority shall take up for consideration
applications for production authorizations submitted during the immediately
preceding period.  The Authority shall issue the authorizations applied for if
all  such  applications  can  be  approved  without  exceeding  the  production
limitation or contravening the obligations of the Authority under a commodity
"
2863,1,"153
"
2864,2,"agreement or arrangement to which it has become a party, as provided in
article 151.
"
2865,3,"2. When a selection must be made among applicants for production
authorizations because of the production limitation set forth in article 151,
paragraphs 2 to 7, or because of the obligations of the Authority under a
commodity agreement or arrangement to which it has become a party, as
provided  for  in  article  151,  paragraph  1,  the  Authority  shall  make  the
selection on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory standards set forth
in its rules, regulations and procedures.

taking into account when commercial production is scheduled
to begin;
"
2871,9,"(c) have  already  invested  the  most  resources  and  effort  in
"
2872,10,"prospecting or exploration.
"
2873,11,"4. Applicants which are not selected in any period shall have priority
"
2874,12,"in subsequent periods until they receive a production authorization.
"
2875,13,"5. Selection shall be made taking into account the need to enhance
opportunities for all States Parties, irrespective of their social and economic
systems or geographical locations so as to avoid discrimination against any
State  or  system,  to  participate  in  activities  in  the  Area  and  to  prevent
monopolization of those activities.
"
2876,14,"6. Whenever fewer reserved areas than non-reserved areas are under
exploitation,  applications  for  production  authorizations  with  respect  to
reserved areas shall have priority.
"
2877,15,"7. The decisions referred to in this article shall be taken as soon as
"
2878,16,"possible after the close of each period.

other entities for reserved areas, shall cover a total area, which need not be a
single  continuous  area,  sufficiently  large  and  of  sufficient  estimated
commercial  value  to  allow  two  mining  operations.    The  applicant  shall
indicate the coordinates dividing the area into two parts of equal estimated
commercial value and submit all the data obtained by him with respect to both
parts.  Without prejudice to the powers of the Authority pursuant to article 17
of this Annex, the data to be submitted concerning polymetallic nodules shall
relate  to  mapping,  sampling,  the  abundance  of  nodules,  and  their  metal
content.  Within 45 days of receiving such data, the Authority shall designate
which  part  is  to  be  reserved  solely  for  the  conduct  of  activities  by  the
Authority through the Enterprise or in association with developing States.
This  designation  may  be  deferred  for  a  further  period  of  45  days  if  the
Authority requests an independent expert to assess whether all data required
by  this  article  has  been  submitted.    The  area  designated  shall  become  a
reserved  area  as  soon  as  the  plan  of  work  for  the  non-reserved  area  is

intends to carry out activities in each reserved area.  This decision may be
taken at any time, unless a notification pursuant to paragraph 4 is received by
the Authority, in which event the Enterprise shall take its decision within a
reasonable time.  The Enterprise may decide to exploit such areas in joint
ventures with the interested State or entity.
"
2886,5,"2. The Enterprise may conclude contracts for the execution of part of
its activities in accordance with Annex IV, article 12.  It may also enter into
joint ventures for the conduct of such activities with any entities which are
eligible  to  carry  out  activities  in  the  Area  pursuant  to  article  153,
paragraph 2(b).  When considering such joint ventures, the Enterprise shall
offer to States Parties which are developing States and their nationals the
opportunity of effective participation.
"
2887,6,"3. The  Authority  may  prescribe,  in  its  rules,  regulations  and
procedures, substantive and procedural requirements and conditions with
respect to such contracts and joint ventures.

2888,7,"4. Any  State  Party  which  is  a  developing  State  or  any  natural  or
juridical person sponsored by it and effectively controlled by it or by other
developing State which is a qualified applicant, or any group of the foregoing,
may notify the Authority that it wishes to submit a plan of work pursuant to
article 6 of this Annex with respect to a reserved area.  The plan of work shall
be considered if the Enterprise decides, pursuant to paragraph 1, that it does
not intend to carry out activities in that area.

accordance with Part XI and those rules, regulations and procedures, the
Authority shall be guided by the following objectives:
"
2906,11,"2. A fee shall be levied for the administrative cost of processing an
application for approval of a plan of work in the form of a contract and shall
be fixed at an amount of $US 500,000 per application.  The amount of the fee
shall be reviewed from time to time by the Council in order to ensure that it
covers the administrative cost incurred.  If such administrative cost incurred
by the Authority in processing an application is less than the fixed amount,
the Authority shall refund the difference to the applicant.
"
2907,12,"3. A contractor shall pay an annual fixed fee of $US 1 million from the
date  of  entry  into  force  of  the  contract.    If  the  approved  date  of
commencement of commercial production is postponed because of a delay in
issuing  the  production  authorization,  in  accordance  with  article  151,  the
annual fixed fee shall be waived for the period of postponement.  From the
date of commencement of commercial production, the contractor shall pay
either the production charge or the annual fixed fee, whichever is greater.

the Authority and of developing States;
to enable the Enterprise to engage in seabed mining effectively
at  the  same  time  as  the  entities  referred  to  in  article  153,
paragraph 2(b); and
to ensure that, as a result of the financial incentives provided to
contractors under paragraph 14, under the terms of contracts
reviewed in accordance with article 19 of this Annex or under
the provisions of article 11 of this Annex with respect to joint
ventures, contractors are not subsidized so as to be given an

"
3024,6,"paragraph 10, and article 164, paragraph 2(d).
"
3025,7,"2. Rules, regulations and procedures on the following items shall fully
"
3026,8,"reflect the objective criteria set out below:
"
3027,9,"(a) Size of areas:
"
3028,10,"163
"
3029,11,"(iii) performance requirements including assurances pursuant
"
3030,12,"to article 4, paragraph 6(c), of this Annex;
categories of resources;
renunciation of areas;
"
3031,13,"(iv)
(v)
(vi) progress reports;
(vii)
(viii)
(ix) prevention  of  interference  with  other  activities  in  the
"
3032,14,"submission of data;
inspection and supervision of operations;
"
3033,15,"marine environment;
transfer of rights and obligations by a contractor;
"
3034,16,"(x)
(xi) procedures for transfer of technology to developing States

"
3035,17,"(xii) mining standards and practices, including those relating
to operational safety, conservation of the resources and
the protection of the marine environment;
"
3036,18,"(b) Duration of operations:
"
3037,19,"The  Authority  shall  determine  the  appropriate  size  of
areas for exploration which may be up to twice as large as those
for  exploitation  in  order  to  permit  intensive  exploration
operations.  The size of area shall be calculated to satisfy the
requirements of article 8 of this Annex on reservation of areas
as  well  as  stated  production  requirements  consistent  with
article 151 in accordance with the terms of the contract taking
into account the state of the art of technology then available for
seabed mining and the relevant physical characteristics of the
areas.    Areas  shall  be  neither  smaller  nor  larger  than  are
necessary to satisfy this objective.
"
3038,20,"(i) Prospecting shall be without time-limit;
(ii) Exploration should be of sufficient duration to permit a
thorough  survey  of  the  specific  area,  the  design  and
construction of mining equipment for the area and the
design  and  construction  of  small  and  medium-size
processing plants for the purpose of testing mining and
processing systems;
"
3039,21,"(iii) The  duration  of  exploitation  should  be  related  to  the
economic  life  of  the  mining  project,  taking  into
consideration such factors as the depletion of the ore, the
useful life of mining equipment and processing facilities
and  commercial  viability.    Exploitation  should  be  of
"
3040,1,"164
"
3041,2,"sufficient  duration  to  permit  commercial  extraction  of
minerals of the area and should include a reasonable time
period for construction of commercial-scale mining and
processing  systems,  during  which  period  commercial
production should not be required.  The total duration of
exploitation, however, should also be short enough to give
the  Authority  an  opportunity  to  amend  the  terms  and
conditions of the plan of work at the time it considers
renewal  in  accordance  with  rules,  regulations  and
procedures which it has adopted subsequent to approving
the plan of work.
"
3042,3,"(c) Performance requirements:
"
3043,4,"The Authority shall require that during the exploration
stage periodic expenditures be made by the operator which are
reasonably related to the size of the area covered by the plan of
work  and  the  expenditures  which  would  be  expected  of  a
bona  fide  operator  who  intended  to  bring  the  area  into
commercial production within the time-limits established by the
Authority.  The required expenditures should not be established
at a level which would discourage prospective operators with
less costly technology than is prevalently in use.  The Authority
shall establish a maximum time interval, after the exploration
stage is completed and the exploitation stage begins, to achieve
commercial  production.    To  determine  this  interval,  the
Authority should take into consideration that construction of
large-scale mining and processing systems cannot be initiated
until  after  the  termination  of  the  exploration  stage  and  the
commencement  of  the  exploitation  stage.    Accordingly,  the
interval to bring an area into commercial production should take
into account the time necessary for this construction after the
completion of the exploration stage and reasonable allowance
should  be  made  for  unavoidable  delays  in  the  construction
schedule.    Once  commercial  production  is  achieved,  the
Authority  shall  within  reasonable  limits  and  taking  into
consideration  all  relevant  factors  require  the  operator  to
maintain commercial production throughout the period of the
plan of work.
"
3044,5,"In  determining  the  category  of  resources  in  respect  of
which a plan of work may be approved, the Authority shall give
emphasis inter alia to the following characteristics:
(i)
"
3045,6,"that certain resources require the use of similar mining
methods; and
that  some  resources  can  be  developed  simultaneously
without undue interference between operators developing
different resources in the same area.
"
3046,7,"(ii)
"
3047,8,"(d) Categories of resources:
"
3048,9,"(e) Renunciation of areas:
"
3049,10,"Nothing in this subparagraph shall preclude the Authority from
approving  a  plan  of  work  with  respect  to  more  than  one
category of resources in the same area to the same applicant.
"
3050,11,"The operator shall have the right at any time to renounce
without  penalty  the  whole  or  part  of  his  rights  in  the  area
covered by a plan of work.
"
3051,1,"165
"
3052,2,"(f) Protection of the marine environment:
"
3053,3,"Rules, regulations and procedures shall be drawn up in
order to secure effective protection of the marine environment
from harmful effects directly resulting from activities in the
Area or from shipboard processing immediately above a mine
site of minerals derived from that mine site, taking into account
the extent to which such harmful effects may directly result
from  drilling,  dredging,  coring  and  excavation  and  from
disposal, dumping and discharge into the marine environment
of sediment, wastes or other effluents.
"
3054,4,"Commercial production shall be deemed to have begun if
an operator engages in sustained large-scale recovery operations
which yield a quantity of materials sufficient to indicate clearly
that the principal purpose is large-scale production rather than
production intended for information gathering, analysis or the
testing of equipment or plant.
"
3055,5,"(g) Commercial production:
"
3056,6,"Article 18
Penalties
"
3057,7,"1. A  contractor's  rights  under  the  contract  may  be  suspended  or
"
3058,8,"terminated only in the following cases:
"
3059,9,"(a)
"
3060,10,"if, in spite of warnings by the Authority, the contractor has
conducted his activities in such a way as to result in serious,
persistent and wilful violations of the fundamental terms of the
contract, Part XI and the rules, regulations and procedures of
the Authority; or
"
3061,11,"(b) if  the  contractor  has  failed  to  comply  with  a  final  binding
"
3062,12,"decision of the dispute settlement body applicable to him.
"
3063,13,"2.
"
3064,14,"In  the  case  of  any  violation  of  the  contract  not  covered  by
paragraph 1(a), or in lieu of suspension or termination under paragraph 1(a),
the  Authority  may  impose  upon  the  contractor  monetary  penalties
proportionate to the seriousness of the violation.
"
3065,15,"3. Except for emergency orders under article 162, paragraph 2(w), the
Authority  may  not  execute  a  decision  involving  monetary  penalties,
suspension or termination until the contractor has been accorded a reasonable
opportunity to exhaust the judicial remedies available to him pursuant to
Part XI, section 5.
"
3066,16,"Article 19
"
3067,17,"Revision of contract
"
3068,18,"1. When circumstances have arisen or are likely to arise which, in the
opinion of either party, would render the contract inequitable or make it
impracticable or impossible to achieve the objectives set out in the contract
or in Part XI, the parties shall enter into negotiations to revise it accordingly.
2. Any  contract  entered  into  in  accordance  with  article  153,
"
3069,19,"paragraph 3, may be revised only with the consent of the parties.
"
3070,1,"166
"
3071,2,"Article 20
"
3072,3,"Transfer of rights and obligations
"
3073,4,"The rights and obligations arising under a contract may be transferred
only with the consent of the Authority, and in accordance with its rules,
regulations and procedures.  The Authority shall not unreasonably withhold
consent to the transfer if the proposed transferee is in all respects a qualified
applicant  and  assumes  all  of  the  obligations  of  the  transferor  and  if  the
transfer does not confer to the transferee a plan of work, the approval of
which would be forbidden by article 6, paragraph 3(c), of this Annex.
"
3074,5,"Article 21
"
3075,6,"Applicable law
"
3076,7,"1. The contract shall be governed by the terms of the contract, the rules,
regulations  and  procedures  of  the  Authority,  Part  XI  and  other  rules  of
international law not incompatible with this Convention.
"
3077,8,"2. Any final decision rendered by a court or tribunal having jurisdiction
under this Convention relating to the rights and obligations of the Authority
and of the contractor shall be enforceable in the territory of each State Party.
3. No  State  Party  may  impose  conditions  on  a  contractor  that  are
inconsistent  with  Part  XI.    However,  the  application  by  a  State  Party  to
contractors sponsored by it, or to ships flying its flag, of environmental or
other laws and regulations more stringent than those in the rules, regulations
and  procedures  of  the  Authority  adopted  pursuant  to  article  17,
paragraph 2(f), of this Annex shall not be deemed inconsistent with Part XI.
"
3078,9,"Article 22
"
3079,10,"Responsibility
"
3080,11,"The  contractor  shall  have  responsibility  or  liability  for  any  damage
arising out of wrongful acts in the conduct of its operations, account being
taken  of  contributory  acts  or  omissions  by  the  Authority.    Similarly,  the
Authority shall have responsibility or liability for any damage arising out of
wrongful acts in the exercise of its powers and functions, including violations
under article 168, paragraph 2, account being taken of contributory acts or
omissions by the contractor.  Liability in every case shall be for the actual
amount of damage.

"
3803,4,"5.
"
3804,5,"(a) Any State which has signed the Convention and which is a
prospective  certifying  State  shall  ensure,  before  making
applications to the Commission under paragraph 2, that areas in
respect  of  which  applications  are  made  do  not  overlap  one
another or areas previously allocated as pioneer areas.  The
States concerned shall keep the Commission currently and fully
informed  of  any  efforts  to  resolve  conflicts  with  respect  to
overlapping claims and of the results thereof.

Convention, that pioneer activities are conducted in a manner
compatible with it.
"
3806,7,"(c) The  prospective  certifying  States,  including  all  potential
claimants,  shall  resolve  their  conflicts  as  required  under
subparagraph (a) by negotiations within a reasonable period.  If

prospective certifying States shall arrange for the submission of
all  such  claims  to  binding  arbitration  in  accordance  with
UNCITRAL  Arbitration  Rules  to  commence  not  later  than
1 May 1983 and to be completed by 1 December 1984.  If one
of  the  States  concerned  does  not  wish  to  participate  in  the
arbitration,  it  shall  arrange  for  a  juridical  person  of  its
nationality to represent it in the arbitration.  The arbitral tribunal
may, for good cause, extend the deadline for the making of the
award for one or more 30-day periods.
"
3807,8,"(d) In determining the issue as to which applicant involved in a
conflict shall be awarded all or part of each area in conflict, the
arbitral tribunal shall find a solution which is fair and equitable,
having regard, with respect to each applicant involved in the
conflict, to the following factors: 
(i)
"
3808,9,"the deposit of the list of relevant coordinates with the
prospective certifying State or States not later than the
date  of  adoption  of  the  Final  Act  or  1  January  1983,
whichever is earlier;
the continuity and extent of past activities relevant to each
area in conflict and to the application area of which it is
a part;
the  date  on  which  each  pioneer  investor  concerned  or
predecessor in interest or component organization thereof
commenced activities at sea in the application area;
the  financial  cost  of  activities  measured  in  constant
United States dollars relevant to each area in conflict and
to the application area of which it is a part; and
the time when those activities were carried out and the
quality of activities.

3815,3,"8.
"
3816,4,"6. A pioneer investor registered pursuant to this resolution shall, from
the date of registration, have the exclusive right to carry out pioneer activities
in the pioneer area allocated to it.
"
3817,5,"(a) Every applicant for registration as a pioneer investor shall pay
to the Commission a fee of $US 250,000.  When the pioneer
investor  applies  to  the  Authority  for  a  plan  of  work  for
exploration and exploitation the fee referred to in Annex III,
article  13,  paragraph  2,  of 
the  Convention  shall  be
$US 250,000.
"
3818,6,"(b) Every registered pioneer investor shall pay an annual fixed fee
of $US 1 million commencing from the date of the allocation of
the pioneer area.  The payments shall be made by the pioneer
investor to the Authority upon the approval of its plan of work
for exploration and exploitation.  The financial arrangements
undertaken pursuant to such plan of work shall be adjusted to
take account of the payments made pursuant to this paragraph.
(c) Every registered pioneer investor shall agree to incur periodic
expenditures, with respect to the pioneer area allocated to it,
until approval of its plan of work pursuant to paragraph 8, of an
amount  to  be  determined  by  the  Commission.    The  amount
should be reasonably related to the size of the pioneer area and
the  expenditures  which  would  be  expected  of  a  bona  fide
operator  who  intends  to  bring  that  area  into  commercial
production within a reasonable time.
"
3819,7,"the  Commission 
"
3820,8,"(a) Within six months of the entry into force of the Convention and
certification  by 
in  accordance  with
paragraph 11, of compliance with this resolution, the pioneer
investor so registered shall apply to the Authority for approval
of  a  plan  of  work  for  exploration  and  exploitation,  in
accordance with the Convention.  The plan of work in respect
of such application shall comply with and be governed by the
relevant provisions of the Convention and the rules, regulations
and  procedures  of  the  Authority,  including  those  on  the
operational requirements, the financial requirements and the
undertakings  concerning 
technology.
Accordingly, the Authority shall approve such application.
"
3821,9,"(b) When an application for approval of a plan of work is submitted
by an entity other than a State, pursuant to subparagraph (a), the
certifying State or States shall be deemed to be the sponsoring
State  for  the  purposes  of  Annex  III,  article  4,  of  the
Convention, and shall thereupon assume such obligations.
"
3822,10,"(c) No  plan  of  work  for  exploration  and  exploitation  shall  be
approved  unless  the  certifying  State  is  a  Party  to  the
Convention.    In  the  case  of  the  entities  referred  to  in
paragraph  1(a)(ii),  the  plan  of  work  for  exploration  and
exploitation shall not be approved unless all the States whose
natural or juridical persons comprise those entities are Parties
to  the  Convention.    If  any  such  State  fails  to  ratify  the
Convention  within  six  months  after  it  has  received  a
notification  from  the  Authority  that  an  application  by  it,  or
sponsored by it, is pending, its status as a pioneer investor or
certifying State, as the case may be, shall terminate, unless the
Council, by a majority of three fourths of its members present
"
3823,11,"the 
"
3824,12,"transfer  of 
"
3825,1,"203
"
3826,2,"9.
"
3827,3,"(a)
"
3828,4,"and voting, decides to postpone the terminal date for a period
not exceeding six months.
In the allocation of production authorizations, in accordance
with article 151 and Annex III, article 7, of the Convention, the
pioneer investors who have obtained approval of plans of work
for  exploration  and  exploitation  shall  have  priority  over  all
applicants other than the Enterprise which shall be entitled to
production  authorizations  for  two  mine  sites  including  that
referred to in article 151, paragraph 5, of the Convention.  After
each  of  the  pioneer  investors  has  obtained  production
authorization  for  its  first  mine  site,  the  priority  for  the
Enterprise contained in Annex III, article 7, paragraph 6, of the
Convention shall apply.
"
3829,5,"(c)
"
3830,6,"(b) Production  authorizations  shall  be  issued  to  each  pioneer
investor  within  30  days  of  the  date  on  which  that  pioneer
investor  notifies  the  Authority  that  it  will  commence
commercial production within five years.  If a pioneer investor
is unable to begin production within the period of five years for
reasons  beyond  its  control,  it  shall  apply  to  the  Legal  and
Technical  Commission  for  an  extension  of  time.    That
Commission shall grant the extension of time, for a period not
exceeding five years and not subject to further extension, if it
is  satisfied  that  the  pioneer  investor  cannot  begin  on  an
economically  viable  basis  at  the  time  originally  planned.
Nothing in this subparagraph shall prevent the Enterprise or any
other pioneer applicant, who has notified the Authority that it
will commence commercial production within five years, from
being given a priority over any applicant who has obtained an
extension of time under this subparagraph.
If  the  Authority,  upon  being  given  notice,  pursuant  to
subparagraph  (b),  determines  that  the  commencement  of
commercial  production  within  five  years  would  exceed  the
production  ceiling  in  article  151,  paragraphs  2  to  7,  of  the
Convention, the applicant shall hold a priority over any other
applicant for the award of the next production authorization
allowed by the production ceiling.
"
3831,7,"(d) If  two  or  more  pioneer  investors  apply  for  production
authorizations to begin commercial production at the same time
and article 151, paragraphs 2 to 7, of the Convention, would not
permit all such production to commence simultaneously, the
Authority shall notify the pioneer investors concerned.  Within
three months of such notification, they shall decide whether
and, if so, to what extent they wish to apportion the allowable
tonnage among themselves.
If,  pursuant  to  subparagraph  (d),  the  pioneer  investors
concerned  decide  not  to  apportion  the  available  production
among themselves they shall agree on an order of priority for
production authorizations and all subsequent applications for
production authorizations will be granted after those referred to
in this subparagraph have been approved.
If,  pursuant  to  subparagraph  (d),  the  pioneer  investors
concerned decide to apportion the available production among
themselves,  the  Authority  shall  award  each  of  them  a
"
3832,8,"(e)
"
3833,9,"(f)
"
3834,1,"204
"
3835,2,"production authorization for such lesser quantity as they have
agreed.  In each case the stated production requirements of the
applicant will be approved and their full production will be
allowed as soon as the production ceiling admits of additional
capacity  sufficient  for 
the
competition.    All  subsequent  applications  for  production
authorizations will only be granted after the requirements of
this subparagraph have been met and the applicant is no longer
subject  to  the  reduction  of  production  provided  for  in  this
subparagraph.
"
3836,3,"the  applicants 
"
3837,4,"involved 
"
3838,5,"in 
"
3839,6,"(g) If the parties fail to reach agreement within the  stated time
period, the matter shall be decided immediately by the means
provided for in paragraph 5(c) in accordance with the criteria
set forth in Annex III, article 7, paragraphs 3 and 5, of the
Convention.
"
3840,7,"10. (a) Any rights acquired by entities or natural or juridical persons
which possess the nationality of or are effectively controlled by
a  State  or  States  whose  status  as  certifying  State  has  been
terminated, shall lapse unless the pioneer investor changes its
nationality and sponsorship within six months of the date of
such termination, as provided for in subparagraph (b).
"
3841,8,"(b) A pioneer investor may change its nationality and sponsorship
from that existing at the time of its registration as a pioneer
investor to that of any State Party to the Convention which has
effective  control  over  the  pioneer  investor  in  terms  of
paragraph l(a).
"
3842,9,"(c) Changes  of  nationality  and  sponsorship  pursuant  to  this
paragraph shall not affect any right or priority conferred on a
pioneer investor pursuant to paragraphs 6 and 8.
"
3843,10,"11. The Commission shall:
"
3844,11,"(a) provide each pioneer investor with the certificate of compliance
with the provisions of this resolution referred to in paragraph 8;
and
"
3845,12,"(b) include  in  its  final  report  required  by  paragraph  11  of
resolution I of the Conference details of all registrations of
pioneer investors and allocations of pioneer areas pursuant to
this resolution.

3846,13,"12. In order to ensure that the Enterprise is able to carry out activities in
"
3847,14,"the Area in such a manner as to keep pace with States and other entities:
"
3848,15,"(a) every registered pioneer investor shall:
"
3849,16,"(i)
"
3850,17,"carry out exploration, at the request of the Commission,
in  the  area  reserved,  pursuant  to  paragraph  3  in
connection with its application, for activities in the Area
by the Authority through the Enterprise or in association
with  developing  States,  on  the  basis  that  the  costs  so
incurred plus interest thereon at the rate of 10 per cent per
annum shall be reimbursed;
"
3851,18,"(ii) provide training at all levels for personnel designated by
"
3852,19,"the Commission;
"
3853,20,"(iii) undertake before the entry into force of the Convention,
to perform the obligations prescribed in the Convention
relating to transfer of technology;

3854,21,"(b) every certifying State shall:
"
3855,1,"205

3857,3,"(ii)
"
3858,4,"ensure that the necessary funds are made available to the
Enterprise  in  a  timely  manner  in  accordance  with  the
Convention, upon its entry into force; and
report periodically to the Commission on the activities
carried  out  by  it,  by  its  entities  or  natural  or  juridical
persons.
"
3859,5,"13. The Authority and its organs shall recognize and honour the rights
and  obligations  arising  from  this  resolution  and  the  decisions  of  the
Commission taken pursuant to it.
"
3860,6,"14. Without prejudice to paragraph 13, this resolution shall have effect
"
3861,7,"until the entry into force of the Convention.

independence or other self-governing status recognized by the
United  Nations,  or  a  territory  under  colonial  domination,

shall  be  implemented  for  the  benefit  of  the  people  of  the
territory  with  a  view  to  promoting  their  well-being  and
development.
"
3870,16,"(b) Where a dispute exists between States over the sovereignty of
a territory to which this resolution applies, in respect of which
the  United  Nations  has  recommended  specific  means  of
settlement, there shall be consultations between the parties to
that dispute regarding the exercise of the rights referred to in
subparagraph (a).  In such consultations the interests of the
people  of  the  territory  concerned  shall  be  a  fundamental
consideration.    Any  exercise  of  those  rights  shall  take  into
account the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and shall
be without prejudice to the position of any party to the dispute.
The  States  concerned  shall  make  every  effort  to  enter  into
provisional arrangements of a practical nature and shall not
jeopardize or hamper the reaching of a final settlement of the

Nations, and to request their compliance with it.
"
3872,18,"RESOLUTION IV
"
3873,19,"The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea,
Bearing in mind that national liberation movements have been invited to
participate in the Conference as observers in accordance with rule 62 of its
rules of procedure,
"
3874,1,"206
"
3875,2,"Decides  that  the  national  liberation  movements,  which  have  been
participating in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea,
shall be entitled to sign the Final Act of the Conference, in their capacity as
observers.

"
3877,4,"STATEMENT OF UNDERSTANDING
CONCERNING A SPECIFIC METHOD
"
3878,5,"TO BE USED IN ESTABLISHING
"
3879,6,"THE OUTER EDGE OF THE CONTINENTAL MARGIN
"
3880,7,"The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea,
Considering the special characteristics of a State’s continental margin
where: (1) the average distance at which the 200 metre isobath occurs is not
more than 20 nautical miles; (2) the greater proportion of the sedimentary
rock of the continental margin lies beneath the rise; and
"
3881,8,"Taking into account the inequity that would result to that State from the
application to its continental margin of article 76 of the Convention, in that,
the mathematical average of the thickness of sedimentary rock along a line
established  at  the  maximum  distance  permissible  in  accordance  with  the
provisions of paragraph 4(a)(i) and (ii) of that article as representing the
entire  outer  edge  of  the  continental  margin  would  not  be  less  than
3.5 kilometres; and that more than half of the margin would be excluded
thereby;
"
3882,9,"Recognizes  that  such  State  may,  notwithstanding  the  provisions  of
article 76, establish the outer edge of its continental margin by straight lines
not exceeding 60 nautical miles in length connecting fixed points, defined by
latitude and longitude, at each of which the thickness of sedimentary rock is
not less than 1 kilometre,
"
3883,10,"Where a State establishes the outer edge of its continental margin by
applying the method set forth in the preceding paragraph of this statement,
this method may also be utilized by a neighbouring State for delineating the
outer edge of its continental margin on a common geological feature, where
its outer edge would lie on such feature on a line established at the maximum
distance permissible in accordance with article 76, paragraph 4(a)(i) and (ii),
along which the mathematical average of the thickness of sedimentary rock
is not less than 3.5 kilometres,
"
3884,11,"The  Conference  requests  the  Commission  on  the  Limits  of  the
Continental  Shelf  set  up  pursuant  to  Annex  II  of  the  Convention,  to  be
governed by the terms of this Statement when making its recommendations
on matters related to the establishment of the outer edge of the continental
margins of these States in the southern part of the Bay of Bengal.

"
3887,3,"RESOLUTION ON DEVELOPMENT OF
"
3888,4,"NATIONAL MARINE SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY
"
3889,5,"AND OCEAN SERVICE INFRASTRUCTURES
"
3890,6,"The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea,
Recognizing that the Convention on the Law of the Sea is intended to
establish a new regime for the seas and oceans which will contribute to the
realization  of  a  just  and  equitable  international  economic  order  through
making provision for the peaceful use of ocean space, the  equitable and
efficient  management  and  utilization  of  its  resources,  and  the  study,
protection and preservation of the marine environment,
"
3891,7,"Bearing in mind that the new regime must take into account, in particular,
the special needs and interests of the developing countries, whether coastal,
land-locked, or geographically disadvantaged,
"
3892,8,"Aware  of the rapid advances being made in the field of marine science
and technology, and the need for the developing countries, whether coastal,
land-locked, or geographically disadvantaged, to share in these achievements
if the aforementioned goals are to be met,
"
3893,9,"Convinced  that, unless urgent measures are taken, the marine scientific
and technological gap between the developed and the developing countries
will widen further and thus endanger the very foundations of the new regime,
Believing that optimum utilization of the new opportunities for social and
economic development offered by the new regime will be facilitated through
action at the national and international level aimed at strengthening national
capabilities in marine science, technology and ocean services, particularly in
the developing countries, with a view to ensuring the rapid absorption and
efficient  application  of  technology  and  scientific  knowledge  available  to
them,
"
3894,10,"that  national  and  regional  marine  scientific  and
technological centres would be the principal institutions through which States
and,  in  particular,  the  developing  countries,  foster  and  conduct  marine
scientific research, and receive and disseminate marine technology,
"
3895,11,"Recognizing the special role of the competent international organizations
envisaged by the Convention on the Law of the Sea, especially in relation to
the establishment and development of national and regional marine scientific
and technological centres,
"
3896,12,"Noting  that present efforts undertaken within the United Nations system
in  training,  education  and  assistance  in  the  field  of  marine  science  and
technology and ocean services are far below current requirements and would
be particularly inadequate to meet the demands generated through operation
of the Convention on the Law of the Sea,
"
3897,13,"Welcoming  recent  initiatives  within  international  organizations  to
promote  and  coordinate  their  major  international  assistance  programmes
aimed at strengthening marine science infrastructures in developing countries,
1. Calls upon all Member States to determine appropriate priorities in
their  development  plans  for  the  strengthening  of  their  marine  science,
technology and ocean services;
"
3898,14,"2. Calls upon the developing countries to establish programmes for the
promotion of technical cooperation among themselves in the field of marine
science, technology and ocean service development;
"
3899,15,"Considering 
"
3900,1,"208
"
3901,2,"3. Urges  the industrialized countries to assist the developing countries
in the preparation and implementation of their marine science, technology and
ocean service development programmes;
"
3902,3,"4. Recommends  that the World Bank, the regional banks, the United
Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Financing System for
Science and Technology and other multilateral funding agencies augment and
coordinate their operations for the provision of funds to developing countries
for the preparation and implementation of major programmes of assistance in
strengthening their marine science, technology and ocean services;
"
3903,4,"5. Recommends that all competent international organizations within
the United Nations system expand programmes within their respective fields
of competence for assistance to developing countries in the field of marine
science,  technology  and  ocean  services  and  coordinate  their  efforts  on  a
system-wide  basis  in  the  implementation  of  such  programmes,  paying
particular attention to the special needs of the developing countries, whether
coastal, land-locked or geographically disadvantaged;
"
3904,5,"6. Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to transmit this
"
3905,6,"resolution to the General Assembly at its thirty-seventh session.
